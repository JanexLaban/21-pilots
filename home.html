            <h2>ABOUT TWENTY ONE PILOTS</h2>
            <hr>
         <p>Twenty One Pilots (stylized in all lowercase or as twenty øne piløts) are an American musical duo 
            from Columbus, Ohio. Initially a band, the group was formed in 2009 by lead vocalist Tyler Joseph 
            along with Nick Thomas and Chris Salih, who both left in 2011. Since their departure, the line-up 
            has consisted of Joseph and drummer Josh Dun. The duo is best known for their singles "Stressed Out
            ", "Ride", and "Heathens". The group received a Grammy Award for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance at 
            the 59th Annual Grammy Awards for "Stressed Out". The band independently released two albums, 
            Twenty One Pilots (2009) and Regional at Best (2011), before being signed by record label Fueled 
            by Ramen in 2012. Their label debut, Vessel, was released in 2013 and became the second album in 
            history on which every track received at least a gold certification, making Twenty One Pilots the 
            first band in the history of music to see every song on two albums earn gold or platinum awards.[1]

            The duo achieved breakthrough success with their fourth album, Blurryface (2015), which produced 
            the successful singles "Stressed Out" and "Ride" and became the first album on which every track 
            received at least a gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America.[2][3] 
            The release of the single "Heathens" also made the group the first alternative artist in history 
            to have two concurrent top five singles in the Billboard Hot 100 and the third rock act in history
             to have two singles simultaneously chart in the top five of the Billboard Hot 100, joining the 
             Beatles and Elvis Presley.[4]
            The duo has released six studio albums in total, with the latest being Scaled and Icy, 
            released on May 21, 2021. They have also garnered ten No. 1 songs on the Alternative Songs chart,
             making them the artist with the fourth-most number-one songs on the chart, just below Linkin Park.
